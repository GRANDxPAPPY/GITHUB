                        Even if you don't like the idea of walking, Taniti offers plenty of ways to get around. Feel free to use our robust travel system. We have public buses that run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Taxis are also available for those interested in late-night activities in the city. Guest should also not be surprised to see the expansive rental car community of the island, meaning there is no place that one cannot reach during their stay.
